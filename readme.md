### Virus Simulation

#### Todos
- Bootstrap or make it pretty somehow
- Problem: one encounter that should have a fixed transmission chance has that chance every 10ms due to draw fct
- Make disease duration normal distributed
- Maybe routine? give each ball a random routine, makes it more human (eg. movement per day)
- Build Continents containing cities
- Make water between continents
- Make movement across water rare
- Create a scale of measure and adjust movement to that
- Time of day impacting movement
- Produce a plot at the end showing how long it took
- Mask feature with little masks on the balls lol
